# Xunit.SkippableFact

This library allows for Xunit tests that can determine during execution that they should report a "skipped" result.
This can be useful when a precondition is not satisfied, or the test is over functionality that does not exist on the platform being tested.

Use `[SkippableFactFP]` or `[SkippableTheory]` to make a test skippable.
